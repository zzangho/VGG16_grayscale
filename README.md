"# VGG16_grayscale" 
Good morning.
This Repository is a page created to help those who want to transform the VGG16 Keras Model.
It will be especially helpful when you want to change the VGG16 color image input to grayscale image input.
There are many hard-coded parts. Please only refer to what you need.
Hoping that the Repository will be helpful.
Thank you.
